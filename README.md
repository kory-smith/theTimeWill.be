[theTimeWill.be](https://thetimewill.be/) is a website built to answer the question "What time will it be x minutes before | after y?". For some reason, I find myself asking that question often.

I know that a lot of other websites do the same thing, but none of them handle the "before" case, and I wanted to play with [Remix](https://remix.run/).

I tried to make the site as SEO-friendly as possible, so hopefully the search "what time will it be 45 minutes before 3:20 PM?" will someday return this site. I really do just want to be helpful to people who have those weird time questions.

## Limitations and Issues
There are a lot of things I could have done better. The most egregious are:
- No mobile styling
- No error messages when invalid data is entered into the form (currently the invalid field is just refocused)

I plan to use this website as a way to practice my CSS when I learn more of that, so stay tuned.
